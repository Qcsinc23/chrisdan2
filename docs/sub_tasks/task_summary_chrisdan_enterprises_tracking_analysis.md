# chrisdan_enterprises_tracking_analysis

I have analyzed the user interface of the tracking system on the Chrisdan Enterprises LLC website. The interface is simple and user-friendly, with a dropdown for cargo type, an input field for the tracking number, and a clear 'Track Your Shipment' button. However, I was unable to test the functionality of the tracking system due to technical limitations with the available tools, which could not interact with the form elements. Therefore, my analysis is based on the visual layout and components of the interface.
